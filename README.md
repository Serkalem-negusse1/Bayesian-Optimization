Practical Bayesian Optimization of Machine Learning Algorithms
This repository provides an implementation of the Bayesian optimization methods described in the paper "Practical Bayesian Optimization of Machine Learning Algorithms". The paper, by Jasper Snoek, Hugo Larochelle, and Ryan P. Adams, was published at NIPS in 2012.


The use of machine learning algorithms often requires careful tuning of learning and model hyperparameters. This tuning can be a "black art," requiring expert experience, rules of thumb, or brute-force search. This work views hyperparameter tuning as the optimization of an unknown black-box function and proposes an automated approach using Bayesian optimization.



This implementation incorporates several key contributions from the paper:

- Gaussian Process (GP) Priors: The generalization performance of a learning algorithm is modeled as a sample from a Gaussian process (GP). This probabilistic model is used to make decisions about which hyperparameters to evaluate next.

- Integrated Expected Improvement (EI): A fully Bayesian treatment of the GP kernel is used, which is argued to be superior to optimizing the GP hyperparameters. This involves marginalizing over the GP hyperparameters and computing an integrated acquisition function.

- Cost-Aware Optimization: The algorithms can account for the variable cost (duration) of experiments, optimizing for the expected improvement per second. This prefers acquiring points that are not only likely to be good but are also likely to be evaluated quickly.

- Parallelization: The framework supports parallel experimentation on multiple cores or machines. It uses a sequential strategy with Monte Carlo estimates to decide on the next point to evaluate, even while other experiments are pending.

- Matérn 5/2 Kernel: The implementation defaults to using the ARD Matérn 5/2 kernel, which is shown to be a more effective choice for practical optimization problems compared to the commonly used squared exponential kernel.


Installation
To get started, you'll need to clone the repository and install the required dependencies.

Bash

git clone https://github.com/Serkalem-negusse1/Bayesian-Optimization.git
cd your-repo-name
pip install -r requirements.txt

**Usage**
This repo contains scripts that demonstrate how to use the implemented optimizers for various tasks, including:

- Logistic Regression on MNIST: Replicating the experiment where the Expected Improvement per second is shown to outperform standard EI in terms of time.

- Online LDA: Demonstrating how the parallelized GP EI MCMC algorithm can find better parameters in significantly less time than a grid search.

- Convolutional Networks on CIFAR-10: An example where the optimizer can surpass human expert-level performance in tuning convolutional neural networks.
